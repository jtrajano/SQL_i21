/*
	Used to validate the items when doing a post. When an error is found, it will execute a RAISERROR. 
	This stored procedure is internally used for validation and it will always be called. 
	
	If you wish to retrieve the errors prior to posting and show it to the user, I suggest you use fnGetItemCostingOnPostErrors
	and return the result back to the user-interface. 

	These are the validations performed by this stored procedure
	1. Check if item id is valid
	2. Check if location is valid
	3. Check for available stock quantity (for outbound stock)
	4. Check if negative stock is allowed (for outbound stock)

	These are the validations outside this stored procedure. 
	1. Check for closed period. 
	2. Check for invalid G/L Account Ids - Do this inside the uspICPostCosting
