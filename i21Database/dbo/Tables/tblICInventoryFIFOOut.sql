/*
## Overview
When a stock is sold from tblICInventory, this is when dblStockOut is increased, the fifo out table will map it to the inventory transaction. 
This table is also used to map the negative fifo stock buckets it was able to revalue after receiving a new stock. 

## Fields, description, and mapping.

	Primay key. 
	Maps: None


*	[intInventoryFIFOId] INT NULL
	Foreign key to tblICInventoryFIFO. It links source of the stock. 
	Maps: None


*	[intInventoryTransactionId] INT NOT NULL
	Foreign key to tblICInventoryTransaction. It links to the inventory transaction. 
	Maps: None
