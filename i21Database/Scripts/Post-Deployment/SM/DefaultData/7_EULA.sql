Provider shall own any suggestions, ideas, enhancement requests, feedback, recommendations, or other information provided by Customer or any other party relating to the Application, including all related Intellectual Property Rights thereto, specifically excluding Customer Data.<br/>4.2. <u>Customer Data</u>. Customer (and its licensors) shall exclusively own all right, title and interest in and to Customer Data and Intellectual Property Rights thereto.</p><p><br/></p><p><strong>5.     INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INDEMNIFICATION</strong></p><p>        5.1. <u>Indemnified Claims</u>. Provider shall defend and indemnify Customer against any “Indemnified Claim,” meaning any third-party claim, suit, or proceeding arising out of direct infringement of any patent, copyright, trade secret, or other intellectual property right by the Application. Provider’s obligations set forth in this Section 7 do not apply to the extent that an Indemnified Claim arises out of: (a) Customer’s breach of this Agreement; or (b) use of the Application in combination with hardware or software not provided by Provider. In the event of an Indemnified Claim, Provider may exercise its right to terminate licenses and require return of the Software.</p><p>        5.2. <u>Litigation &amp; Additional Terms</u>. Provider’s obligations pursuant to Section 7 will only apply if Customer provides prompt written notice of and cooperates in the defense of the Indemnified Claim. Provider will control the defense of any Indemnified Claim, including appeals, negotiations, and any settlement or compromise thereof; provided Customer will have the right, not to be exercised unreasonably, to reject any settlement or compromise that requires that it admit wrongdoing or liability or subjects it to any ongoing affirmative obligations.</p><p><br/></p><p><strong>6.     FEES AND PAYMENT</strong></p><p>        6.1. <u>Subscription Fees and Payment</u>. Customer shall pay the Subscription Fees, in advance, for the right to access and use the Application during the applicable Subscription Period, as set forth in the Ordering Document. Subscription Fees shall be invoiced annually before the corresponding Subscription Period, which dates may be specified in the Ordering Document. Invoices shall be due and payable within thirty (30) days of the invoice date, and in no event later than one day before the start of the applicable Subscription Period. Any future Proposals shall be at Provider’s then-published rates or as otherwise agreed by the parties in the Proposal. All payment obligations for Subscription Fees are non-cancelable and all amounts paid are nonrefundable. Please refer to Schedule 5 – Invoicing and Payment for additional details.</p><p>        6.2. <u>Data Storage and Backup Fees</u>. The Subscription Fees include the amounts of online data storage and hourly data backups as set forth in the Proposal. If the amount of disk storage required exceeds these limits, Customer will be charged the then-current storage fees at the time the Subscription Fee is due. Provider shall use reasonable efforts to notify Customer when its usage approaches ninety percent (90%) of the allotted storage space; however, any failure by Provider to notify Customer shall not affect Customer’s responsibility for such additional storage charges. Any additional data storage shall be at Provider’s then applicable rates or as otherwise agreed in a Proposal.</p><p>        6.3. <u>Other Terms</u>. Invoicing and payment terms are set forth in Schedule 5 – Charging and Invoicing.</p><p><br/></p><p><strong>7.     DATA PROTECTION AND INFORMATION SECURITY</strong></p><p>Provider shall maintain and enforce reasonable technical and organizational safeguards against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration or unauthorized disclosure or access of the Customer Data that are at least equal to industry standards for applications similar to the Application. However, because the success of this process depends on equipment, software, and services over which Provider has limited control, Customer agrees that Provider has no responsibility or liability for the deletion or failure to store any Customer Data or communications maintained or transmitted by the Application. Customer shall be responsible for backing up its own Customer Data. Customer has set no limit on the number of transmissions Customer may send or receive through the Application or the amount of storage space used, except as provided in the Proposal, and Customer’s volume of transmissions may affect its Subscription Fees.</p><p><br/></p><p><strong>8.     REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES</strong></p><p>        8.1. <u>Provider Representations and Warranties</u>. Provider represents and warrants that: (i) Standard Support Services shall be performed in a professional and workmanlike manner; and (ii) Provider shall, prior to making a new feature of the Application available, (a) scan it with commercially available anti-virus software and shall use reasonable efforts to remove viruses capable of being detected with such software, (b) not intentionally include in the Application any viruses, worms, trap doors, Trojan horses or other malicious code. Except as expressly set forth in this Section, Provider makes no representations and warranties and hereby specifically disclaims, all representations and warranties express or implied, arising by law or otherwise, arising under or relating to this Agreement.</p><p>        8.2. <u>Conditions</u>. The warranties above are contingent upon: (i) the Application is implemented and operated by Customer in accordance with the Documentation; (ii) Customer notifies Provider of any warranty defect as promptly as reasonably possible after becoming aware of such defect, but in no event more than ten (10) calendar days after becoming aware of such defect; (iii) Customer has properly used all Updates made available with respect to the Application, and any updates recommended by Provider with respect to any third-party software products that affect the performance of the Application; (iv) Customer has properly maintained all associated equipment and software and provided the environmental conditions in accordance with applicable written specifications provided by the applicable manufacturer of such equipment and software; (v) Customer has not introduced other equipment or software that causes an adverse impact on the Application; (vi) Customer has paid all amounts due hereunder and is not in default of any provision of this Agreement; (vii) any legacy software with respect to which the Application is to operate contains clearly defined interfaces and correct integration code, and (viii) Customer has made no changes (nor permitted any changes to be made other than by or with the express approval of Provider) to the Application, except as may be permitted herein.</p><p>        8.3. <u>Remedy</u>. The parties negotiated this Section and it reflects a fair allocation of risk. Customer’s exclusive remedies, and Provider’s sole liability, with respect to any breach of this Section 10 will be, at Provider’s option, for Provider to (i) promptly correct the applicable material defects that affect performance of and access to the Application (provided that, Customer notifies Provider in writing of such defect within the applicable warranty period); (ii) provide a workaround that is substantially similar in form and function reasonable acceptable to Customer; or (iii) if neither of the foregoing are reasonably practicable, accept termination of Customer’s access and use of the Application and refund to Customer a pro-rata portion of unused, pre-paid Subscription Fees.</p><p>        8.4. <u>Cooperation</u>. Provider shall cooperate with Customer, at Customer’s sole expense, with respect to any investigation, inquiry or audit by any regulatory authority that supervises, oversees or regulates Customer during the Term of this Agreement and for such time thereafter as may be required by applicable law.</p><p><br/></p>

	<h1 id="title-text" class="with-breadcrumbs">SCHEDULE 4 - MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE</h1>
	<div id="main-content" class="wiki-content">
        <p>This MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE (this “Maintenance Schedule”) is a Schedule to the Master Services Agreement to which this Schedule is attached. The Master Services Agreement and this Maintenance Schedule, together with any other attached Schedules and Ordering Documents, together are the Agreement.</p><p><br/></p><p><strong>1.     MAINTENANCE SERVICES</strong></p><p>        1.1. <u>Maintenance Services</u>. In exchange for the Maintenance Fee, Provider will provide Software support and maintenance services (collectively, &quot;Maintenance Services&quot;) to Customer during the term set forth in the Ordering Document. Maintenance Services consist of three primary components:</p><p>              1.1.1. Software updates that relate to tax and other accounting and regulatory changes. These changes are monitored by Customer and Provider and built into the software release cycle. This also covers cost related to improving processes and simplifying system functions.</p><p>              1.1.2. Improvements to the Products such as new features and functionality based on collective discussion with Customers.</p><p>              1.1.3. Software support services consisting of tools used to assist with troubleshooting Software issues. This includes help manuals, help desk tools, help desk ticketing system, telephone support, error correction, and the knowledgeable support team Provider employs.</p><p>        1.2. <u>Additional Services</u>. Additional services will be provided by Provider upon Customer request at the Professional Service Fee Rates listed on Schedule 5 – Invoicing and Payments.</p><p><br/><strong>2.     ERROR CORRECTION SERVICES</strong></p><p>        2.1. <u>Errors</u>. An “Error” is an event in which the Software does not perform as intended. Provider will exercise reasonable efforts to investigate and correct all Errors reported to Provider by Customer as Errors in accordance with this Schedule. Customer will inform Provider of any Errors by submitting a help desk ticket in Provider’s help desk system (or by phone if help desk system is not functioning correctly). In order to ensure timely resolution to errors, Customer must report, at a minimum, the following information:</p><ul><li>Version of Software</li><li>Instructions on how to reproduce the reported Error</li><li>User impacted</li><li>Any other necessary and/or useful information relating to identifying and reproducing the reported error.</li></ul><p>        2.2. <u>Error Classification</u>. Provider has 3 severity levels for Error classification. Each level has its own service level as described further in this section.</p><ul><li><em>Severity 1- Blocker</em>. An Error that is consistently blocking any of Customer’s material daily production processes. Workaround may not be possible. The customer may or may not be at risk of losing money from idle users or that they cannot perform sales or service because of the issue.</li><li><em>Severity 2- Major</em>. An Error that is not consistently blocking Customer’s material daily production process but the function is critical for periodic execution (e.g. batch posting, printing reports, closing year, import/export process). Also includes Errors where a reasonable workaround has been implemented until resolution in a future version.</li><li><em>Severity 3 - Standard</em>. An Error that leads to minor or no loss of function (e.g., cosmetic issues) where a workaround is not even required. These issues should not impede execution of any material business functions.</li></ul><p>        2.3. <u>Solution Path</u>. The solution path for each level of Severity is defined in the following charts based on plan type. If Provider is unable to complete resolution within such timeframe, Provider will continue to work to resolve such Error on a continuous basis (i.e., 24x7) until resolved.</p><h2

For the purposes of this Agreement, a “good faith dispute” means a good faith dispute by Customer of certain amounts invoiced under this Agreement.  A good faith dispute will be deemed to exist only if (a) Customer has given written notice of the dispute to Provider within 15 days of the date of an invoice and (b) the notice explains Customer''s position in reasonable detail.  A good faith dispute will not exist as to an invoice in its entirety merely because certain amounts on the invoice have been disputed.</p>

        <p>This HOSTING SCHEDULE (this “Hosting Schedule”) is a Schedule to the Master Services Agreement to which this Schedule is attached.

Provider will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the Hosting Services 99.9% of the time, as measured each calendar quarter. If Provider is unable to meet this service level, Customer will be eligible to receive a credit to apply to future Hosting Fees based upon the prorated Unavailability for that calendar quarter. “Unavailability” means that the Software is inaccessible due to the Hosting Services, provided that Unavailability that is a result of scheduled maintenance will not be considered for service credit calculations. Any credit for Unavailability will be calculated by dividing the number of minutes of Unavailability by the total number of minutes in that calendar quarter.</p><p>        1.3. <u>Hosting Restrictions</u>. The Hosting Services may only be used to host the Software and may not be used for any other means. Provider will not exercise control over the content of the information passing through the network, provided that, Provider reserves the right to police its network to verify compliance with all agreed upon the Agreement.</p><p><br/></p><p><strong>2.     CUSTOMER DATA OWNERSHIP</strong></p><p>Customer (and its licensors) shall exclusively own all right, title and interest in and to Customer Data and Intellectual Property Rights thereto.</p><p><br/></p><p><strong>3.     FEES AND PAYMENT</strong></p><p>        3.1. <u>Hosting Fees and Payment</u>.

Invoicing and payment terms are set forth in Schedule 5 – Charging and Invoicing.</p><p><br/></p><p><strong>4.     DATA PROTECTION AND INFORMATION SECURITY</strong></p><p>Provider shall maintain and enforce reasonable technical and organizational safeguards against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration or unauthorized disclosure or access of the Customer Data that are at least equal to industry standards for applications similar to the Application.
