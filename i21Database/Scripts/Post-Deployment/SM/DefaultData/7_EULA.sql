<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 10.4.2. Provider will: (i)&nbsp;deliver to Customer all Deliverables and Products for which Customer has fully paid; (ii) and immediately discontinue (and cause its contractors and personnel to immediately discontinue) all use of Customer Materials.

<p><br></p>
<p><strong>11. FORCE MAJEURE</strong></p>
<p>Neither party will be liable under, or deemed to be in breach of, this Agreement for any delay or failure in performance under this Agreement or the applicable Order Document that is caused by any of the following events: acts of God, civil or military authority, war; fires; power outages; earthquakes; floods; unusually severe weather; strikes or labor disputes (excluding Provider''s subcontractors); delays in transportation or delivery as a result of a Force Majeure Event; epidemics; terrorism or threats of terrorism; and any similar event that is beyond the reasonable control of the non-performing party ("Force Majeure Event").

If a Force Majeure Event continues for ten (10) days or longer, and the non-performing party is delayed or unable to perform under this Agreement or any Order Document because of the Force Majeure Event, then the performing party will have the right to terminate this Agreement or the Order Document, in whole or in part, upon written notice to the non-performing party.</p>
